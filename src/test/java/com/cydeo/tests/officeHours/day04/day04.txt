=============== Implicitly Wait   vs   Thread.sleep =======================

    = Thread.sleep() =

    This method is from Java, not Selenium. It pauses the program based on given millisecond.
    It waits for the duration given. be careful not to use too long otr to less.
    It is recommended to minimize the use of thread.sleep using too much slows the execution of tests.

    - call every time you need
    - wait for whole duration, not dynamic(static)
    - not selenium wait
 ============================================================================


 = Implicitly Wait =

 driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS); //time should be over visibility time

 - call it once, (set of driver)
 - waits while trying to findElement
 - wait until element found or time runs out(dynamic)
 - applies for all findElement methods

 === HOW FIND ELEMENT METHODS WORK?  ===

 We provide locator and try to find element to do same actions using findElement method

 1-  if element is found it will return WebElement

 2-  if element is not found
          -it will check ImplicitlyWait

          YES:
          - it will keep trying to locate element uo to time we set
          - if it finds it inside this time it will return WebElement
          - Otherwise it will throw NSE (No such element)

          NO: it will throw NSE (No such element)

    NOTES:
      - This waits for element to be found in HTML, It only works when we call findElement method.
